This piece of passage is about something basic. They can be learnt in every senior high school in China. (You know, China's Math is absolutely hard.)

## Part 1 Easy Formulas

The sum of an arithmetic sequence: $s = \frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$

The sum of a geometric sequence: $s = \frac{a_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$

Something common:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2$$
