This piece of passage is about something basic. They can be learnt in every senior high school in China. (You know, China's Math is absolutely hard.)

## Part 1 Easy Formulas

The sum of an arithmetic sequence:
$$s = \frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$$

The sum of a geometric sequence:
$$s = \frac{a_1(1-q^n)}{1-q}$$

Something common:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2$$

Work out the square root of $a$ with Newton's Method:
$$x_{i+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_i + \frac{a}{x_i} \right)$$

## Part 2 Something vital in the VECTOR field

Score Point Formula(I don't know if this formula is called like this):  
If three points $A, B, C$ are on the same line, for each $O$ out of the line, it is clear that:  
$$\vec{OB} = \frac{\vec{OA} + \lambda \vec{OC}}{1+\lambda}, \lambda = \frac{AB}{BC}$$

Polarization identity:  
In a triangle $\bigtriangleup ABC$,   
$$\boldsymbol{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{b} = \frac{1}{4} \left( (\boldsymbol{a} + \boldsymbol{b})^2 + (\boldsymbol{a} - \boldsymbol{b})^2 \right)$$

Rotation Formula:  
$$\boldsymbol{a} = (x,y)$$
$$\boldsymbol{b} = (x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta, x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)$$
