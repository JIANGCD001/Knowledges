Matrix is very important in competitive programming.

## Part 1 The Relationships between Matrix and Vector

A matrix represents many vectors whose position are written in the columns of a matrix. It also stands for the thought meaning packing and solving.
Since it is adapted from the equation groups, it also represents a linear equation group. Thus the problems regarding equation groups can be worked out with the use of matrix.

## Part 2 Defination

A matrix is a group of numbers arranged like:
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$$
The number of the columns and rows can be changed according to the needs.  
We use captal characters to name a matrix, for example, a matrix $A$.
